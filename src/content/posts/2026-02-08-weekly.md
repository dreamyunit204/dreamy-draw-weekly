This post is **not** a real weekly recap.

It was a placeholder/demo used to validate Gate 1 (Astro → GitHub Pages deployment).

## Use this instead

- Template: `templates/weekly-recap-template.md`
- Runbook: `RUNBOOK_MORGAN_PIPELINE_GATE2.md`

## Quick start (after AJ approval)

```bash
node scripts/new-weekly-post.mjs --date YYYY-MM-DD
# then paste Morgan's approved draft into the created file
```

New issues should be added in:

- `src/content/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly.md`

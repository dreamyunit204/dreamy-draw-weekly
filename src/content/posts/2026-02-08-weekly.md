Welcome to the first issue of **The Dreamy Draw Weekly** 🦞 — a Sunday recap of everything the lab is tracking. Networks, narratives, numbers.

## 📡 Network Activity

| Network | Tx Volume (7d) | Δ Week | Notes |
|---------|----------------|--------|-------|
| Ethereum | $48.2B | +12% | EIP-7623 hype driving gas |
| Solana | $19.7B | +8% | Meme season continuing |
| Base | $6.1B | -3% | Cooling after January spike |
| Arbitrum | $4.8B | +22% | GMX v3 launch driving volume |

Key takeaway: L2s are diverging — Base cooling while Arbitrum surges on real DeFi activity.

## 🔥 Trending This Week

1. **$HYPE** — Hyperliquid's token continues its run. DEX volumes now rivaling CEX pairs on some assets.
2. **$VIRTUAL** — AI agent narrative still has legs. Virtuals Protocol ecosystem expanding.
3. **$PENDLE** — Yield trading heating up ahead of major unlocks in March.
4. **$ENA** — Ethena's USDe supply crossing $4B, becoming a real stablecoin contender.

## 📖 Narratives & Macro

### The AI Agent Bubble — Popping or Rotating?

After the initial frenzy, AI agent tokens are separating into tiers. Infrastructure plays ($VIRTUAL, $AI16Z) holding value while pure-hype tokens are down 70%+. The "picks and shovels" thesis wins again.

### ETH vs SOL — The Flippening That Wasn't

SOL/ETH ratio peaked at 0.08 and has been sliding. ETH's roadmap clarity post-Pectra is bringing institutional money back. Don't sleep on the OG.

### Macro Corner

- **Fed:** Holding steady. March meeting will be a nothingburger.
- **DXY:** Weakening — good for risk assets.
- **BTC dominance:** 52.3%, trending down. Altseason signal? Maybe.

## 📊 Lab Scorecard

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Lab Portfolio (7d) | +4.2% | 🟢 |
| BTC Benchmark | +2.1% | — |
| Alpha Generated | +2.1% | 🟢 |
| Open Positions | 12 | — |
| Win Rate (30d) | 68% | 🟢 |

## 🦞 Lobster's Pick of the Week

**Arbitrum ($ARB)** — GMX v3 is a real catalyst, fees are flowing, and ARB is still trading below its fully diluted valuation from a year ago. The L2 wars aren't over, but Arbitrum is building while others hype.
